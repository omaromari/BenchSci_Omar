# BenchSci_Omar
This repository contains the source code for the Back-end task provided by BenchSci, written by Omar N. Omari.
Disclaimer: The creation of this algorithm would not have been possible had it not been for the endless supoort from colleagues on forums such as Stacked Overflow, and those who generated the modules "request" and "BeautifulSoup".
- Written in Python, the algorithm extracts figures' Captions, Descriptions and URL from PubMed articles, and peforms a co-occurrence search algorithm between each figure's caption and description to find common occuring words.
- The newly extracted data is then stored in a CSV and JSON file for convenience, and is then loaded into a NoSQL database and displayed on webpage.
